  abstract = {The coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos off nuclei has eluded detection for four decades, even though its predicted cross section is by far the largest of all low-energy neutrino couplings. This mode of interaction offers new opportunities to study neutrino properties and leads to a miniaturization of detector size, with potential technological applications. We observed this process at a 6.7{$\sigma$} confidence level, using a low-background, 14.6-kilogram CsI[Na] scintillator exposed to the neutrino emissions from the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Characteristic signatures in energy and time, predicted by the standard model for this process, were observed in high signal-to-background conditions. Improved constraints on nonstandard neutrino interactions with quarks are derived from this initial data set.},

Such a synthesis procedure always requires a subsequent transfer process to be performed in order to eliminate the metallic substrate and transfer the graphene onto the desired surface. We show here that such a transfer process causes significant contamination of the graphene film with residual Fe and Ni metal impurities. Fe contamination derives from the use of Fe-based etching solutions to dissolve Ni (or Cu) substrates, while residual Ni (or Cu) is due to an incomplete metal substrate etching. The presence of these metallic impurities within the transferred graphene film affects tremendously its electrochemical behavior when adopted as an electrode material.},

We focus on the study of neighborhood frames with constant domains and we offer in the first part of the paper a series of new completeness results for salient classical systems of first order modal logic. Among other results we show that it is possible to prove strong completeness results for normal systems without the Barcan Formula (like FOL + K) in terms of neighborhood frames with constant domains. The first order models we present permit the study of many epistemic modalities recently proposed in computer science as well as the development of adequate models for monadic operators of high probability. Models of this type are either difficult of impossible to build in terms of relational Kripkean semantics [40]. We conclude by introducing general first order neighborhood frames with constant domains and we offer a general completeness result for the entire family of classical first order modal systems in terms of them, circumventing some well-known problems of propositional and first order neighborhood semantics (mainly the fact that many classical modal logics are incomplete with respect to an unmodified version of either neighborhood or relational frames). We argue that the semantical program that thus arises offers the first complete semantic unification of the family of classical first order modal logics.},

However, these advancements are accompanied by significant increase in data and compute needs, which precludes real-time imaging, feedback and decision-making capabilities with conventional approaches. Here, we demonstrate a workflow that leverages artificial intelligence at the edge and high-performance computing to enable real-time inversion on X-ray ptychography data streamed directly from a detector at up to 2 kHz.

However, deviations from perfection can be useful in some applications, as they make it possible to tailor the local properties of graphene and to achieve new functionalities. In this article, the present knowledge about point and line defects in graphene are reviewed. Particular emphasis is put on the unique ability of graphene to reconstruct its lattice around intrinsic defects, leading to interesting effects and potential applications. Extrinsic defects such as foreign atoms which are of equally high importance for designing graphene-based devices with dedicated properties are also discussed.},

Compared to alternative methods, the technique has relatively loose requirements on the physical setup and has been demonstrated to operate across the visible light, x-ray, and electron regimes. This thesis reviews progress in the field followed by four chapters of original work. The unique imaging process of ptychography is initially examined in theoretical terms and the conclusions that are drawn are subsequently applied in all three of the main imaging domains; visible light, x-ray, and electron. The development of several new algorithms is discussed, which alleviate many of the current experimental constraints. These include the processing of diffraction patterns that are sampled grossly below the conventional Nyquist limit, the automatic correction of detector imperfections, the imaging of mixed states through multiple wavelength illumination, and the reconstruction of partially coherent data in the STEM configuration through the deconvolution of an extended source.},

This suggests that in such case either both disjuncts are false and so the distributive laws are not applicable to quantum propositions (this inference is accepted in quantum logic) or the disjuncts are not bivalent, i.e., neither true nor false, therefore the principle of bivalence is not applicable to quantum propositions. But, to accept the latter inference, one must explain how quantum propositions become bivalent in the classical limit. This paper shows the emergence of bivalence through the interaction between a quantum system and its environment and compares the environmentally induced bivalence with the classical limit of quantum logic.},

  abstract = {The interface of complex oxide heterostructures sets the stage for various electronic and magnetic phenomena. Many of these collective effects originate from the precise structural arrangement at the interface that in turn governs local spin- and charge interactions. Currently, interfacial straining, so the naturally evolving compressive or tensile strain by mismatch of the neighboring lattices, is the most common route towards engineering collective material properties -- yet, significant progress might require exploration of entirely new approaches towards interface correlations. In this work, we turn the page by looking at the interface of a perfectly relaxed, unstrained heterostructure, where we identify a highly ordered Moire lattice at an inherently disordered SrTiO\$\_3\$ (STO) - LSAT interface. Using high-resolution reciprocal space mapping via synchrotron based X-Ray diffraction, we find long-ranged ordered supercells of 106/107 unit cells of STO/LSAT, caused by lattice relaxation through high-temperature annealing. Model calculations confirm the experimentally observed scattering phenomena, showing that cross-interfacial bonding is locally different at the Moire-overlap points. Notably, the presence of such super-ordered structures in the family of 2D electron gas systems sets the ideal conditions for Moire-motif tuned plasmonic responses and ferroelectric super-crystallinity and opens up the possibility to novel interface functionalities in these simple perovskites.},

However, the improvements on the electrical conductivities of conventional conductors are limited, such as purification and growing single crystal of metals.

As a result, a maximum electrical conductivity three orders of magnitude higher than the highest on record (more than 3,000 times higher than that of Cu) is obtained in such embedded graphene. As a result, using the graphene as reinforcement, an electrical conductivity as high as {$\approx$}117\% of the International Annealed Copper Standard and significantly higher than that of Ag is achieved in bulk graphene/Cu composites with an extremely low graphene volume fraction of only 0.008\%.

  abstract = {In the past decade, semiconducting qubits have made great strides in overcoming decoherence, improving the prospects for scalability and have become one of the leading contenders for the development of large-scale quantum circuits. In this Review, we describe the current state of the art in semiconductor charge and spin qubits based on gate-controlled semiconductor quantum dots, shallow dopants and colour centres in wide-bandgap materials. We frame the relative strengths of the different semiconductor qubit implementations in the context of applications such as quantum simulation, computing, sensing and networks. By highlighting the status and future perspectives of the basic types of semiconductor qubits, this Review aims to serve as a technical introduction for non-specialists and a forward-looking reference for scientists intending to work in this field.},

However, owing to lens aberrations and multiple scattering of electrons in the sample, the image resolution is reduced by a factor of 3 to 10. By inversely solving the multiple scattering problem and overcoming the electron-probe aberrations using electron ptychography, we demonstrate an instrumental blurring of less than 20 picometers and a linear phase response in thick samples. The measured widths of atomic columns are limited by thermal fluctuations of the atoms. Our method is also capable of locating embedded atomic dopant atoms in all three dimensions with subnanometer precision from only a single projection measurement.},

However, for conventional imaging methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), atomic resolution with picometer precision cannot usually be achieved for weakly-scattering samples or radiation-sensitive materials, such as 2D materials. Here, we demonstrate low-dose, sub-angstrom resolution imaging with picometer precision using mixed-state electron ptychography. We show that correctly accounting for the partial coherence of the electron beam is a prerequisite for high-quality structural reconstructions due to the intrinsic partial coherence of the electron beam. The mixed-state reconstruction gains importance especially when simultaneously pursuing high resolution, high precision and large field-of-view imaging. Compared with conventional atomic-resolution STEM imaging techniques, the mixed-state ptychographic approach simultaneously provides a four-times-faster acquisition, with double the information limit at the same dose, or up to a fifty-fold reduction in dose at the same resolution.},

  abstract = {Ptychographic imaging is a powerful means of imaging beyond the resolution limits of typical x-ray optics. Recovering images from raw ptychographic data, however, requires the solution of an inverse problem, namely, phase retrieval. Phase retrieval algorithms are computationally expensive, which precludes real-time imaging. In this work, we propose PtychoNN, an approach to solve the ptychography data inversion problem based on a deep convolutional neural network. We demonstrate how the proposed method can be used to predict real-space structure and phase at each scan point solely from the corresponding far-field diffraction data. Our results demonstrate the practical application of machine learning to recover high fidelity amplitude and phase contrast images of a real sample hundreds of times faster than current ptychography reconstruction packages. Furthermore, by overcoming the constraints of iterative model-based methods, we can significantly relax sampling constraints on data acquisition while still producing an excellent image of the sample. Besides drastically accelerating acquisition and analysis, this capability has profound implications for the imaging of dose sensitive, dynamic, and extremely voluminous samples.},

  abstract = {Topological materials have become the focus of intense research in recent years, since they exhibit fundamentally new physical phenomena with potential applications for novel devices and quantum information technology. One of the hallmarks of topological materials is the existence of protected gapless surface states, which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the bulk wave functions. This review provides a pedagogical introduction into the field of topological quantum matter with an emphasis on classification schemes. We consider both fully gapped and gapless topological materials and their classification in terms of nonspatial symmetries, such as time-reversal, as well as spatial symmetries, such as reflection. Furthermore, we survey the classification of gapless modes localized on topological defects. The classification of these systems is discussed by use of homotopy groups, Clifford algebras, K-theory, and non-linear sigma models describing the Anderson (de-)localization at the surface or inside a defect of the material. Theoretical model systems and their topological invariants are reviewed together with recent experimental results in order to provide a unified and comprehensive perspective of the field. While the bulk of this article is concerned with the topological properties of noninteracting or mean-field Hamiltonians, we also provide a brief overview of recent results and open questions concerning the topological classifications of interacting systems.},

  abstract = {This study examines acoustic and aerodynamic characteristics of consonants in standard Korean and in Cheju, an endangered Korean language. The focus is on the well-known three-way distinction among voiceless stops (i.e., lenis, fortis, aspirated) and the two-way distinction between the voiceless fricatives /s/ and /s*/. While such a typologically unusual contrast among voiceless stops has long drawn the attention of phoneticians and phonologists, there is no single work in the literature that discusses a body of data representing a relatively large number of speakers. This study reports a variety of acoustic and aerodynamic measures obtained from 12 Korean speakers (four speakers of Seoul Korean and eight speakers of Cheju). Results show that, in addition to findings similar to those reported by others, there are three crucial points worth noting. Firstly, lenis, fortis, and aspirated stops are systematically differentiated from each other by the voice quality of the following vowel. Secondly, these stops are also differentiated by aerodynamic mechanisms. The aspirated and fortis stops are similar in supralaryngeal articulation, but employ a different relation between intraoral pressure and flow. Thirdly, our study suggests that the fricative /s/ is better categorized as ``lenis'' rather than ``aspirated''. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of Korean data for theories of the voicing contrast and their phonological representations.},

We argue that this account is not only theoretically advantageous, but also has far-reaching empirical consequences. In particular, we predict modal versions of reasoning fallacies from the heuristics and biases literature. Additionally, we derive the modal semantics in an entirely transparent manner, as it is based on the compositional semantics of Korean modal expressions that are morphosyntactically decomposed into a conditional and an evaluative predicate.},

For the standard application in optics, where the two projections implement Fourier modulus and object support constraints, respectively, the difference map reproduces the ``hybrid'' form of Fienup's input--output map when a particular choice is made for two of the parameters. The geometric construction of the difference map illuminates the distinction between its fixed points and the recovered object, as well as the mechanism whereby the form of stagnation encountered by alternating projection schemes is avoided. When support constraints are replaced by object histogram or atomicity constraints, the difference map lends itself to crystallographic phase retrieval. Numerical experiments with synthetic data suggest that structures with hundreds of atoms can be solved.},

The properties of these devices are wide-ranging, but they are restricted by nature of the underlying thick STO substrate. Here, single-crystal freestanding membranes based on LAO/STO heterostructures were fabricated, which can be directly integrated with other materials via van der Waals stacking. The key properties of LAO/STO are preserved when LAO/STO membranes are formed. Conductive atomic force microscope lithography is shown to successfully create reversible patterns of nanoscale conducting regions, which survive to millikelvin temperatures. The ability to form reconfigurable conducting nanostructures on LAO/STO membranes opens opportunities to integrate a variety of nanoelectronics with silicon-based architectures and flexible, magnetic, or superconducting materials.},

It is shown that both the error-reduction algorithm for the problem of a single intensity measurement and the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for the problem of two intensity measurements converge.

The algorithm combines the information in both domains to arrive at the complete description of the wavefront or signal.

Moreover, these deterministic placement methods also open the door to fabricate complex devices, which would be otherwise very difficult to achieve by conventional bottom-up nanofabrication approaches, and to fabricate fully-encapsulated devices with exquisite electronic properties. The integration of 2D materials with existing technologies such as photonic and superconducting waveguides and fiber optics is another exciting possibility. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of the deterministic placement methods, describing and comparing the different alternative methods available in the literature, and we illustrate their potential to fabricate van der Waals heterostructures, to integrate 2D materials into complex devices and to fabricate artificial bilayer structures where the layers present a user-defined rotational twisting angle.},

Image simulations are used to comprehensively evaluate the validity of these metrics over a broad range of experimental conditions. We develop two metrics, areal oversampling and Ronchigram magnification, which predict reconstruction success with high accuracy. Lastly, we validate these conclusions with experimental ptychographic data, and demonstrate close agreement between trends in simulated and experimental data. Using these metrics, we achieve experimental multislice reconstructions at a scan step of \$1.0 {\textbackslash}unit\{{\textbackslash}AA/px\}\$, enabling large field-of-view (\${$>\backslash$}!18{\textbackslash}unit\{nm\}\$), data-efficient reconstructions.

It is of particular importance for microscopy imaging with diffraction set-ups where high quality lenses are not available. The inversion scheme allowing the phase retrieval is based on the use of an iterative algorithm. In this work, we address the question of the choice of the iterative process in the case of data corrupted by photon or electron shot noise. Several noise models are presented and further used within two inversion strategies, the ordered subset and the scaled gradient. Based on analytical and numerical analysis together with Monte-Carlo studies, we show that any physical interpretations drawn from a CDI iterative technique require a detailed understanding of the relationship between the noise model and the used inversion method. We observe that iterative algorithms often assume implicitly a noise model. For low counting rates, each noise model behaves differently. Moreover, the used optimization strategy introduces its own artefacts. Based on this analysis, we develop a hybrid strategy which works efficiently in the absence of an informed initial guess. Our work emphasises issues which should be considered carefully when inverting experimental data.},

We show how our benchmarking suite can be used to both detect as well as quantify errors on both measured and spectator qubits.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Vor einiger Zeit wurde ein neues Prinzip zur Registrierung der Gesamtinformation (Amplituden und Phasen) in einem Beugungsbild angegeben, welches nicht -- wie die Holographie -- Interferenzen der Streuwellen mit               einer               Referenzwelle voraussetzt. Von wesentlicher Bedeutung sind hierbei Interferenzen               benachbarter               Streuwellen, die entstehen, wenn die Objektfunktion               Q(x,y)               mit einer verallgemeinerten Prim{\"a}rwellenfunktion               p(x,y)               multipliziert wird. Im Fourierraum (Beugungsdiagramm) entstehen dabei Faltungen der Fouriertransformierten dieser Funktionen; durch geeignete Formung von               p(x,y)               l{\"a}{\ss}t sich erreichen, da{\ss} die erw{\"a}hnten, zur Phasenbestimmung ausnutzbaren Interferenzen benachbarter Streustrahlen resultieren. Zum Unterschied zur Holographie soll dieses Verfahren ``Ptychographie'' ({$\xi$} = Falte) genannt werden. Das Verfahren ist f{\"u}r periodische und nichtperiodische Strukturen anwendbar; die einfachsten und {\"u}bersichtlichsten Beziehungen ergeben sich f{\"u}r Kreuzgitter. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird die Theorie f{\"u}r Raumgitter mit und ohne Ber{\"u}cksichtigung der dynamischen Theorie erweitert. An einem praktischen Beispiel werden die auftretenden Effekte demonstriert.                        ,                             Some time ago a new principle was proposed for the registration of the complete information (amplitudes and phases) in a diffraction diagram, which does not --as does Holography -- require the interference of the scattered waves with a single reference wave. The basis of the principle lies in the interference of neighbouring scattered waves which result when the object function               Q(x,y)               is multiplied by a generalized primary wave function               p(x,y)               in Fourier space (diffraction diagram) this is a convolution of the Fourier transforms of these functions. The above mentioned interferences necessary for the phase determination can be obtained by suitable choice of the shape of               p(x,y)               . To distinguish it from holography this procedure is designated ``ptychography'' ({$\xi$} = fold). The procedure is applicable to periodic and aperiodic structures. The relationships are simplest for plane lattices. In this paper the theory is extended to space lattices both with and without consideration of the dynamic theory. The resulting effects are demonstrated using a practical example.},

  abstract = {Traditional measures of dysphonia vary in their reliability and in their correlations with perceptions of grade. Measurements of cepstral peak prominence (CPP) have been shown to correlate well with perceptions of breathiness. Because it is a measure of periodicity, CPP should also predict roughness. The ability of CPP and other acoustic measures to predict overall dysphonia and the subcategories of breathiness and roughness in pathological voice samples is explored. Preoperative and postoperative speech samples from 19 patients with unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis who underwent operative intervention were analyzed by trained listeners and by measures of smoothed CPP (CPPS), noise-to-harmonic ratio (NHR), amplitude perturbation quotient (APQ), relative average perturbation (RAP), and smoothed pitch perturbation quotient (sPPQ). The data were analyzed with bivariate Pearson correlation statistics. Grade of dysphonia and breathiness ratings correlated better with measurements of CPPS than with the other measures. CPPS from samples of connected speech (CPPS-s) best predicted overall dysphonia. None of the measures were useful in predicting roughness.},

Yet, the need for time consuming iterative phase recovery hampers real-time imaging. While supervised deep learning strategies have increased reconstruction speed, they sacrifice image quality. Furthermore, these methods' demand for extensive labeled training data is experimentally burdensome. Here, we propose an unsupervised physics-informed neural network reconstruction method, PtychoPINN, that retains the factor of 100-to-1000 speedup of deep learning-based reconstruction while improving reconstruction quality by combining the diffraction forward map with real-space constraints from overlapping measurements. In particular, PtychoPINN gains a factor of 4 in linear resolution and an 8 dB improvement in PSNR while also accruing improvements in generalizability and robustness. This blend of performance and computational efficiency offers exciting prospects for high-resolution real-time imaging in high-throughput environments such as X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) and diffraction-limited light sources.},

Our investigations combining density functional theory (DFT) and deep-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that DFT-predicted strain-driven morphotropic phase boundary involving monoclinic phases manifest as diverse domain structures at room temperatures, featuring continuous distributions of dipole orientations and mobile domain walls. Detailed analysis of dynamic structures reveals that the enhanced piezoelectric response observed in stretched PbTiO\$\_3\$ membranes results from small-angle rotations of dipoles at domain walls, distinct from conventional polarization rotation mechanism and adaptive phase theory inferred from static structures. We identify a ferroelectric topological structure, termed "dipole spiral," which exhibits a giant intrinsic piezoelectric response (\${$>\$$}320 pC/N). This helical structure, primarily stabilized by entropy and possessing a rotational zero-energy mode, unlocks new possibilities for exploring chiral phonon dynamics and dipolar Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like interactions.},

  abstract = {Aberration-corrected optics have made electron microscopy at atomic resolution a widespread and often essential tool for characterizing nanoscale structures. Image resolution has traditionally been improved by increasing the numerical aperture of the lens ({$\alpha$}) and the beam energy, with the state-of-the-art at 300 kiloelectronvolts just entering the deep sub-{\aa}ngstr{\"o}m (that is, less than 0.5 {\aa}ngstr{\"o}m) regime. Two-dimensional (2D) materials are imaged at lower beam energies to avoid displacement damage from large momenta transfers, limiting spatial resolution to about 1 {\aa}ngstr{\"o}m. Here, by combining an electron microscope pixel-array detector with the dynamic range necessary to record the complete distribution of transmitted electrons and full-field ptychography to recover phase information from the full phase space, we increase the spatial resolution well beyond the traditional numerical-aperture-limited resolution. At a beam energy of 80 kiloelectronvolts, our ptychographic reconstruction improves the image contrast of single-atom defects in MoS2 substantially, reaching an information limit close to 5{$\alpha$}, which corresponds to an Abbe diffraction-limited resolution of 0.39 {\aa}ngstr{\"o}m, at the electron dose and imaging conditions for which conventional imaging methods reach only 0.98 {\aa}ngstr{\"o}m.},

The effective preparation of high-quality flexible YBCO films therefore plays a key role in this development. We present a novel approach for transferring water-sensitive YBCO films onto flexible substrates without any buffer layer. Freestanding YBCO film on a polydimethylsiloxane substrate is extracted by etching the Sr3Al2O6 sacrificial layer from the LaAlO3 substrate. In addition to the obtained freestanding YBCO thin film having a Tc of 89.1 K, the freestanding YBCO thin films under inward and outward bending conditions have Tc of 89.6 K and 88.9 K, respectively. A comprehensive characterization involving multiple experimental techniques including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman and X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy is conducted to investigate the morphology, structural and electronic properties of the YBCO film before and after the extraction process where it shows the preservation of the structural and superconductive properties of the freestanding YBCO virtually in its pristine state. Further investigation reveals the formation of a YBCO passivated layer serves as a protective layer which effectively preserves the inner section of the freestanding YBCO during the etching process. This work plays a key role in actualizing the fabrication of flexible oxide thin films and opens up new possibilities for a diverse range of device applications involving thin-films and low-dimensional materials.},

Chemical reactors, however, are often thicker than the depth of field, limiting the lateral spatial resolution in projection images. To overcome this limit and reach higher lateral spatial resolution, wave propagation within the sample environment has to be taken into account. Here, we demonstrate this effect recording a ptychographic projection of copper(I) oxide nanocubes grown on two sides of a polyimide foil. Reconstructing the nanocubes using the conventional ptychographic model shows the limitation in the achieved resolution due to the thickness of the foil. Whereas, utilizing a multi-slice approach unambiguously separates two sharper reconstructions of nanocubes on both sides of the foil. Moreover, we illustrate how ptychographic multi-slice reconstructions are crucial for high-quality imaging of chemical processes by ex situ studying copper(I) oxide nanocubes grown on the walls of a liquid cell.},

One well known algorithm is the principal components generalized projections algorithm (PCGPA) for extracting pulses from Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) measurements. Here, we discuss the development of the PCPGA and introduce new developments including an operator formalism that allows for the convenient addition of external constraints and the development of more robust algorithms. A close cousin, the ptychographic iterative engine will also be covered and compared to the PCGPA. Additional developments using other algorithmic strategies will also be discussed along with new developments combining optics and high-speed electronics to achieve megahertz measurement rates.},

In particular, ferroic orderings offer access to a rich spectrum of fundamental physics phenomena, in addition to a range of technological applications. The heterogeneous integration of ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials is a fruitful way to design multiferroic oxides. The realization of freestanding heterogeneous membranes of multiferroic oxides is highly desirable. In this study, epitaxial BaTiO3/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 freestanding bilayer membranes are fabricated using pulsed laser epitaxy. The membrane displays ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism above room temperature accompanying the finite magnetoelectric coupling constant. This study reveals that a freestanding heterostructure can be used to manipulate the structural and emergent properties of the membrane. In the absence of the strain caused by the substrate, the change in orbital occupancy of the magnetic layer leads to the reorientation of the magnetic easy-axis, that is, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. These results of designing multiferroic oxide membranes open new avenues to integrate such flexible membranes for electronic applications.},

Methods A total of 4,524 Korean participants with vocally healthy (n~=~410) and dysphonic voices (n~=~4,114) participated in this study. The speech task consisted of a sustained vowel /a/ and a sentence reading the Korean passage "Walk". CPP and CPPS values were quickly and automatically measured in sustained vowel and continuous speech tasks using Praat script. Furthermore, three veteran speech language pathologists (SLPs) scored the severity of dysphonia using the GRBAS scale (grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, strain) and Consensus Auditory Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V). Results Three SLPs showed high inter- and intra-rater reliabilities (IRR) in auditory-perceptual (A-P) evaluation. Significant differences were confirmed in CPP and CPPS between the normally healthy and pathological voice groups for both voice tasks (P {$<$} 0.01). The measured values of CPP and CPPS varied depending on the laryngeal pathology. In the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the CPP\_Vowel (CPP\_V), CPPS\_V, CPP\_Sentence (CPP\_S), and CPPS\_S cut-off values were {$<$}21.5, {$<$}12.0, {$<$}19.7, and {$<$}10.1, respectively. Through ROC curve analysis, it was confirmed that CPP and CPPS had excellent diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing disordered voice (area under the ROC: 0.951--0.966). Conclusion We investigated the reference values for CPP and CPPS measured with Praat for Korean speakers and confirmed that cepstral analysis is a promising tool for differentiating pathological voice.},

  abstract = {In word-initial position, Korean voiceless tense, lax, and aspirated stops differ in acoustic properties that fall within the conventional ``consonant'' portion, as well as properties falling within the ``vowel'' portion beginning at voicing onset. Experiment 1 investigated the relative importance of these properties to stop identification by testing Korean listeners' perception of cross-spliced stimuli whose initial consonant portion specified one phonation type and whose vowel portion specified another type. Experiment 2 tested whether the voiced vowel portion alone could cue the phonation type of a deleted initial consonant. The results of both experiments showed that vowel portions from syllables with lax onsets were necessary and largely sufficient to cue lax stops. For vowel portions from syllables with aspirated or tense onsets, the role of vocalic information in stop identification depended on the particular combination of cross-spliced portions (Experiment 1); in the absence of any consonant portion (Experiment 2), both tense and aspirated vowel portions were usually heard as having had tense onsets. The perceptual patterns are interpreted in terms of the acoustic properties of the stimuli. Low vocalicf0 provided the most salient information for lax stops; tense and aspirated stop identification depended on a combination of VOT, f0, and H 1-H 2 characteristics. The perceptual dominance off0 over VOT for lax stops is consistent with the size of the f0 differences in word- (and phrase-) initial position, as well as the prominent role of the resulting tonal patterns in Korean intonational phonology.},

This study examines two acoustic parameters---voice onset time (VOT) and fundamental frequency (f0)---to see how their values are diachronically changing (i.e., sound change) and whether there are individual differences in sound change. Acoustic data on VOT and f0 are compared with the results of Han \& Weitzman's (1970). Results show that VOT values between the lax and aspirated stop are merged whereas f0 differences are maximized to contrast the aspirated and lax onsets. This can be characterized by the loss of a consonantal opposition in terms of VOT and the maximization of a vocalic portion in terms of f0. In addition, there are individual differences in sound change. The results suggest that Korean is still undergoing a sound change and the process of a sound change is analogous to tonogenesis. Further discussion is necessary on how tonogenesis can be applied for the explanation of a sound change in Korean.},

Here we achieve this goal by realizing quantum-critical spin-glass dynamics on thousands of qubits with a superconducting quantum annealer. We first demonstrate quantitative agreement between quantum annealing and time~evolution of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation in small spin glasses. We then measure dynamics in three-dimensional spin glasses on thousands of qubits, for which classical simulation of many-body quantum dynamics is intractable. We extract critical exponents that clearly distinguish quantum annealing from the slower stochastic dynamics of analogous Monte Carlo algorithms, providing both theoretical and experimental support for large-scale quantum simulation and a scaling advantage in energy optimization.},

The interactions between nearest neighbors are of XX, YY or ZZ type, depending on the direction of the link; different types of interactions may differ in strength. The model is solved exactly by a reduction to free fermions in a static Z2 gauge field. A phase diagram in the parameter space is obtained. One of the phases has an energy gap and carries excitations that are Abelian anyons. The other phase is gapless, but acquires a gap in the presence of magnetic field. In the latter case excitations are non-Abelian anyons whose braiding rules coincide with those of conformal blocks for the Ising model. We also consider a general theory of free fermions with a gapped spectrum, which is characterized by a spectral Chern number {$\nu$}. The Abelian and non-Abelian phases of the original model correspond to {$\nu$}=0 and {$\nu$}={\textpm}1, respectively. The anyonic properties of excitation depend on {$\nu$} mod 16, whereas {$\nu$} itself governs edge thermal transport. The paper also provides mathematical background on anyons as well as an elementary theory of Chern number for quasidiagonal matrices.},

To the extent that there is, how should semanticists model the meanings of modal expressions whose meanings make reference to graded concepts? Modals are usually thought of as (non-graded) quantificational expressions, but there is also a tradition of treating some modal concepts -- such as goodness, likelihood, and obligation -- on the analogy of graded concepts like height, weight, and temperature. Recently there has been increased attention to scalar aspects of the meanings of modal expressions, but there are still many interesting open questions about how far modal gradation extends, and how it relates to grammatical gradability of the type studied in the extensive literature on degree expressions.},

  abstract = {From extreme strain to bending, the possibilities in the manipulation of freestanding films of oxide perovskites bring a novel landscape to their properties and brings them one step closer to their application. It is therefore of great importance to fully understand the inherent properties of such films, in which dimensionality and surface effects can play a major role in defining the properties of the materials ground state. This paper reports the properties of freestanding (FS) films of the canonical oxide, SrTiO3 (STO) with thicknesses 20, 30, 40 and 80 nm. We show that the relaxed ultrathin STO FS films become polar at temperatures as high as 85 K, in contrast to the quantum paraelectric behavior of bulk. Our findings are based on the softening of the ferroelectric mode towards the ferroelectric transition temperature Tc and its consecutive hardening below Tc with further decreasing temperature, probed with THz time domain spectroscopy in transmission mode. We find almost no thickness dependence in Tc. Moreover, we characterize the antiferrodistortive (AFD) phase transition in STO FS by X-ray diffraction (XRD) probing superlattice reflections characteristic for the rotation of the TiO6 octahedra. Our results point to a higher phase transition temperature in comparison to bulk STO, as well as an unbalanced domain population favoring the rotation axis to be in plane. X-ray linear dichroism results further show a preferential Ti xz/yz orbital occupancy at the surface, but with a complete degeneracy in the t2g states in the inner part of the film indicating that the AFD distortion does not strongly affect the t2g splitting. These findings demonstrate that STO FS films have clearly different properties than bulk.},

  abstract = {Ptychography is a form of Coherent Diffractive Imaging, where diffraction patterns are processed by iterative algorithms to recover an image of a specimen. Although mostly applied in two dimensions, ptychography can be extended to produce three dimensional images in two ways: via multi-slice ptychography or ptychographic tomography. Ptychographic tomography relies on 2D ptychography to supply projections to conventional tomographic algorithms, whilst multi-slice ptychography uses the redundancy in ptychographic data to split the reconstruction into a series of axial slices. Whilst multi-slice ptychography can handle multiple-scattering thick specimens and has a much smaller data requirement than ptychographic tomography, its depth resolution is relatively poor. Here we propose an imaging modality that combines the benefits of the two approaches, enabling isotropic 3D resolution imaging of thick specimens with a small number of angular measurements. Optical experiments validate our proposed method.},

Here we demonstrate a novel method to use all this information, instead of just the small subset used in the original `stepping out' procedure developed in the 1990s, thus greatly suppressing noise. We further develop a method for designing an improved probe (illumination function) to further decrease noise effects during the deconvolution division. Combining these two with an iterative procedure for the deconvolution, which avoids the usual difficulty of a divide by a small number, we show in model calculations that WDDM competes well with the modern conventional iterative methods like ePIE (the extended Ptychographical Iterative Engine).},

Here we show that an alternative form of multi-measurement imaging, ptychography, can be extended to three dimensions and can successfully recover images in the presence of multiple scattering and when the projection approximation is not applicable. We demonstrate our technique experimentally using visible light, where it has applications in imaging thick samples such as biological tissues; however the results also have important implications for x ray and electron imaging.},

This meta-analysis presents a retrospective appraisal of scientific reports, which evaluated the relation between perceived overall voice quality and several acoustic-phonetic correlates. Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated using meta-analytic techniques. Correlation coefficients between perceptual judgments and acoustic measures were computed. Where more than one correlation coefficient for a specific acoustic marker was available, a weighted average correlation coefficient was calculated. This was the case in 36 acoustic measures on sustained vowels and in 3 measures on continuous speech. Acoustic measures were ranked according to the strength of the correlation with perceptual voice quality ratings. Acoustic markers with more than one correlation value available in literature and yielding a homogeneous weighted r of 0.60 or above were considered to be superior. The meta-analysis identified four measures that met these criteria in sustained vowels and three measures in continuous speech. Although acoustic measures are routinely utilized in clinical voice examinations, the results of this meta-analysis suggest that caution is warranted regarding the concurrent validity and thus the clinical utility of many of these measures.},

  abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis Automatic voice evaluation is usually performed on stable sections of sustained vowels, which often cannot capture hoarseness properly. The measures cepstral peak prominence (CPP) and smoothed CPP (CPPS) do not require exact determination of the cycles of fundamental frequency like established perturbation-based measures. They can also be applied to text recordings. In this study, they were compared with perceptual evaluation of voice quality and the German roughness-breathiness-hoarseness (RBH) scheme. Study Design Retrospective data analysis. Methods Seventy-three hoarse patients (48.3{\textpm}16.8 years) uttered the vowel /e/ and read the German version of the text ``The North Wind and the Sun''. The text recordings were evaluated perceptually by five speech therapists and physicians according to the RBH scale. The criterion ``overall quality'' was measured on a 4-point scale and a visual analog scale. For the human-machine correlation, the automatic measures of the Praat program (vowels only) and the ``cpps'' software were compared with the experts' ratings. The experiments were repeated for speakers with jitter {$\leq$}5\% or shimmer {$\leq$}5\% (n=47). Results For the entire group (n=73), the best human-machine results for most of the rating criteria were obtained for text-based CPP and CPPS (up to {\textbar}{$\rho\vert$}=0.73). For the 47 selected speakers, the correlation was remarkably worse for all measures but still best for text-based CPP and CPPS ({\textbar}{$\rho\vert\leq$}0.50). Conclusions Cepstrum analysis should be performed on a text recording. Then, it outperforms all perturbation-based measures, and it can be a meaningful objective support for perceptual analysis.},

The first lecture contains an introduction to the replica method, along with a concrete application to the computation of the eigenvalue distribution of random matrices in the GOE. In the second lecture, the solution of the SK model is derived, along with the phenomenon of replica symmetry breaking (RSB). In the third part, the physical meaning of the RSB is explained. The ultrametricity of the space of pure states emerges as a consequence of the hierarchical RSB scheme. Moreover, it is shown how some low temperature properties of physical observables can be derived by invoking the stochastic stability principle. Lecture four contains some rigorous results on the SK model: the existence of the thermodynamic limit, and the proof of the exactness of the hierarchical RSB solution.},

A theoretical description of cepstral processing of voiced speech containing aspiration noise, together with supporting empirical data, is provided in order to illustrate the nature of the noise baseline estimation process. Taking the Fourier transform of the liftered (filtered in the cepstral domain) cepstrum produces a noise baseline estimate. It is shown that Fourier transforming the low-pass liftered cepstrum is comparable to applying a moving average (MA) filter to the logarithmic spectrum and hence the baseline receives contributions from the glottal source excited vocal tract and the noise excited vocal tract. Because the estimation process resembles the action of a MA filter, the resulting noise baseline is determined by the harmonic resolution (as determined by the temporal analysis window length) and the glottal source spectral tilt. On selecting an appropriate temporal analysis window length the estimated baseline is shown to lie halfway between the glottal excited vocal tract and the noise excited vocal tract. This information is employed in a new harmonics-to-noise (HNR) estimation technique, which is shown to provide accurate HNR estimates when tested on synthetically generated voice signals.},

Recognition accuracy increases when recognizers are trained with acoustic features in conjunction with articulatory ones. Traditionally, acoustic features are represented by mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) while articulatory features are represented by the locations or trajectories of the articulators. We propose the articulatory cepstral coefficients (ACCs) as features which are the cepstral coefficients of the time-location articulatory signal. We show that ACCs yield state-of-the-art results in phoneme classification and recognition on benchmark datasets over a wide range of experiments. The similarity of MFCCs and ACCs and their superior performance in isolation and conjunction indicate that common algorithms can be effectively used for acoustic and articulatory signals.},

However, the underlying mechanism of structural evolution or degradation at the microscopic scale on the electrocatalyst surface during the OER has not been elucidated because of the sluggish yet dynamic character of the reaction. To address this issue, the direct observation of the unstable electrocatalytic activity is necessary. In this study, we demonstrate that the structural destabilization of epitaxial cubic perovskite BaRuO3 thin films during the OER originates from Ba leaching, Ru dissolution, and oxygen vacancy. A thin film geometry is adopted to selectively visualize the structural decomposition at the well-defined sample surface. The cubic BaRuO3 thin film initially exhibits high OER activity, which drastically decreases even during the first cyclic voltammetry cycle and is completely lost after the first cycle. The OER activity loss is closely related to the generation of structural defects on the surface, indicating the absence of the Ba and Ru atoms. This study proposes the mechanism underlying the OER activity that can be extended to elucidate the structural destabilization in various Ru- and Ir-based oxide catalysts.},

Here, we introduce a new member of the \$ {\textbackslash}mathrm\{SrO-\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Al\}\_\{2\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\_\{3\}\$ family,\$ {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Sr\}\_\{4\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Al\}\_\{2\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\_\{7\},\$, and demonstrate its high dissolution rate, about 10 times higher than that of \$ {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Sr\}\_\{3\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Al\}\_\{2\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\_\{6\}\$. The high-dissolution-rate of \$ {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Sr\}\_\{4\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Al\}\_\{2\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{O\}\_\{7\}\$ is most likely related to the more discrete Al-O networks and higher concentration of water-soluble Sr-O species in this compound. Our work significantly facilitates the preparation of freestanding membranes and sheds light on the integration of multifunctional perovskite oxides in practical electronic devices.},

  abstract = {Since the successful exfoliation of graphene, various methodologies have been developed to identify the number of layers of exfoliated graphene. The optical contrast, Raman G-peak intensity, and 2D-peak line-shape are currently widely used as the first level of inspection for graphene samples. Although the combination analysis of G- and 2D-peaks is powerful for exfoliated graphene samples, its use is limited in chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown graphene because CVD-grown graphene consists of various domains with randomly rotated crystallographic axes between layers, which makes the G- and 2D-peaks analysis difficult for use in number identification. We report herein that the Raman Si-peak intensity can be a universal measure for the number identification of multilayered graphene. We synthesized a few-layered graphene via the CVD method and performed Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, we measured the Si-peak intensities from various individual graphene domains and correlated them with the corresponding layer numbers. We then compared the normalized Si-peak intensity of the CVD-grown multilayer graphene with the exfoliated multilayer graphene as a reference and successfully identified the layer number of the CVD-grown graphene. We believe that this Si-peak analysis can be further applied to various 2-dimensional (2D) materials prepared by both exfoliation and chemical growth.},

To suggest what prompted the invention of the term cepstrum, this article narrates the historical and mathematical background that led to its discovery. The computations of earlier simple echo representations have shown that the spectrum representation domain results does not belong in the frequency or time domain. Bogert et al. (1963) chose to refer to it as quefrency domain and later termed the spectrum of the log of a time waveform as the cepstrum. The article also recounts the analysis of Al Oppenheim in relation to the cepstrum. It was in his theory for nonlinear signal processing, referred to as homomorphic systems, that the realization of the characteristic system of homomorphic convolution was reminiscent of the cepstrum. To retain both the relationship to the work of Bogart et al. and the distinction, the term power cepstrum was eventually applied to the nonlinear mapping in homomorphic deconvolution . While most of the terms in the glossary have faded into the background, the term cepstrum has survived and has become part of the digital signal processing lexicon.},

Method  Existing evidence was combined with expert consensus in areas with a lack of evidence. In addition, a survey of clinicians and a peer review of an initial version of the protocol via VoiceServe and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's Special Interest Group 3 (Voice and Voice Disorders) Community were used to create the recommendations for the final protocols. Results  The protocols include recommendations regarding technical specifications for data acquisition, voice and speech tasks, analysis methods, and reporting of results for instrumental evaluation of voice production in the areas of laryngeal endoscopic imaging, acoustics, and aerodynamics. Conclusion  The recommended protocols for instrumental assessment of voice using laryngeal endoscopic imaging, acoustic, and aerodynamic methods will enable clinicians and researchers to collect a uniform set of valid and reliable measures that can be compared across assessments, clients, and facilities.},

Reasonable acquisition time requires high beam current and the ability to quantitatively detect both large and minute changes in signal. A new hybrid pixel array detector (PAD), the second-generation Electron Microscope Pixel Array Detector (EMPAD-G2), addresses this challenge by advancing the technology of a previous generation PAD, the EMPAD. The EMPAD-G2 images continuously at a frame-rates up to 10 kHz with a dynamic range that spans from low-noise detection of single electrons to electron beam currents exceeding 180 pA per pixel, even at electron energies of 300 keV. The EMPAD-G2 enables rapid collection of high-quality STEM data that simultaneously contain full diffraction information from unsaturated bright-field disks to usable Kikuchi bands and higher-order Laue zones. Test results from 80 to 300 keV are presented, as are first experimental results demonstrating ptychographic reconstructions, strain and polarization maps. We introduce a new information metric, the maximum usable imaging speed (MUIS), to identify when a detector becomes electron-starved, saturated or its pixel count is mismatched with the beam current.},

CPP is determined by measuring the amplitude difference from the highest peak of the cepstrum to the corresponding regression line, drawn directly below the cepstral peaks and when a smoothening factor is applied, sCPP is obtained. Cepstral analysis has been reported to be a reliable and valid measure for voice evaluation even for signals with high level of aperiodicity, which the time based measures fails to evaluate. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the reference values for CPP and sCPP in young adults with normal voice in the age range of 20--40 years.

These topological properties are the natural generalizations of the time reversal breaking (TRB) quantum Hall insulator in 2+1 dimensions. The TRI quantum spin Hall insulator in 2+1 dimensions and the topological insulator in 3+1 dimension can be obtained as descendants from the fundamental TRI insulator in 4+1 dimensions through a dimensional reduction procedure. The effective topological field theory, and the \$Z\_2\$ topological classification for the TRI insulators in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions are naturally obtained from this procedure. All physically measurable topological response functions of the TRI insulators are completely described by the effective topological field theory. Our effective topological field theory predicts a number of novel and measurable phenomena, the most striking of which is the topological magneto-electric effect, where an electric field generates a magnetic field in the same direction, with an universal constant of proportionality quantized in odd multiples of the fine structure constant \${\textbackslash}alpha=e{\textasciicircum}2/{\textbackslash}hbar c\$. Finally, we present a general classification of all topological insulators in various dimensions, and describe them in terms of a unified topological Chern-Simons field theory in phase space.},

Transition metal dichalcogenide moir{\'e} heterostructures provide another model system for the study of correlated quantum phenomena5 because of their strong light--matter interactions and large spin--orbit coupling. However, experimental observation of correlated insulating states in this system is challenging with traditional transport techniques. Here we report the optical detection of strongly correlated phases in semiconducting WSe2/WS2 moir{\'e} superlattices. We use a sensitive optical detection technique and reveal a Mott insulator state at one hole per superlattice site and surprising insulating phases at 1/3 and 2/3 filling of the superlattice, which we assign to generalized Wigner crystallization on the underlying lattice6--11. Furthermore, the spin--valley optical selection rules12--14 of transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures allow us to optically create and investigate low-energy excited spin states in the Mott insulator. We measure a very long spin relaxation lifetime of many microseconds in the Mott insulating state, orders of magnitude longer than that of charge excitations.

In this work, we study the role of epitaxial strain on the electronic behavior of thin SrIrO\$\_3\$ films. We find that compressive epitaxial strain leads to metallic transport behavior, but a slight tensile strain shows gapped behavior. Temperature-dependent resistivity measurements are used to examine different behaviors in films as a function of strain. We find Kondo contributions to the resistivity, with stronger effects in films that are thinner and under less compressive epitaxial strain. These results show the potential to tune SrIrO\$\_3\$ into Kondo insulating states and open possibilities for a quantum critical point that can be controlled with strain in epitaxial films.},

  abstract = {Stacking different two-dimensional crystals into van der Waals heterostructures provides an exciting approach to designing quantum materials that can harness and extend the already fascinating properties of the constituents. Heterobilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides are particularly attractive for low-dimensional semiconductor optics because they host interlayer excitons---with electrons and holes localized in different layers---which inherit valley-contrasting physics from the monolayers and thereby possess various novel and appealing properties compared to other solid-state nanostructures. This Review presents the contemporary experimental and theoretical understanding of these interlayer excitons. We discuss their unique optical properties arising from the underlying valley physics, the strong many-body interactions and electrical control resulting from the electric dipole moment, and the unique effects of a moir{\'e} superlattice on the interlayer exciton potential landscape and optical properties.},

A~detector records an extensive data set consisting of many inference patterns obtained as an object is displaced to various positions relative to an illumination field. A~computer algorithm of some type is then used to invert these data into an image. It has three key advantages: it does not depend upon a~good-quality lens, or indeed on using any lens at all; it can obtain the image wave in phase as well as in intensity; and it can self-calibrate in the sense that errors that arise in the experimental set up can be accounted for and their effects removed. Its transfer function is in theory perfect, with resolution being wavelength limited. Although the main concepts of ptychography were developed many years ago, it has only recently (over the last 10 years) become widely adopted. This chapter surveys visible light, x-ray, electron, and EUV ptychography as applied to microscopic imaging. It describes the principal experimental arrangements used at these various wavelengths. It reviews the most common inversion algorithms that are nowadays employed, giving examples of meta code to implement these. It describes, for those new to the field, how to avoid the most common pitfalls in obtaining good quality reconstructions. It also discusses more advanced techniques such as modal decomposition and strategies to cope with three-dimensional () multiple scattering.},

By the use of a Wigner distribution, influences of the instrument function can be entirely separated from the information pertaining to the specimen. The final solution yields an unambiguous estimate of the complex value of the specimen function at a resolution which in theory is only limited by the electron wavelength. The faithfulness of the image processing is shown to be not seriously affected by specimen thickness or partial coherence in the illuminating beam. The inversion procedure is remarkably noise insensitive, implying that it should result in a robust and practicable experimental technique, though one that will require very large computing facilities.},

  abstract = {Purpose  Smoothed cepstral peak prominence (CPPS) and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) are acoustic measures related to the periodicity, harmonicity, and noise components of an acoustic signal. To date, there is little evidence about the advantages of CPPS over HNR in voice diagnostics. Recent studies indicate that voice fundamental frequency (F0) and intensity (sound pressure level [SPL]), sample duration (DUR), vowel context (speech vs. sustained phonation), and syllable stress (SS) may influence CPPS and HNR results. The scope of this work was to investigate the effects of voice F0 and SPL, DUR, SS, and token on CPPS and HNR in dysphonic voices. Method  In this retrospective study, 27 Brazilian Portuguese speakers with voice disorders were investigated. Recordings of sustained vowels (SVs) /a:/ and manually extracted vowels (EVs) /a/ from Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice sentences were acoustically analyzed with the Praat program. Results  There was a highly significant effect of F0, SPL, and DUR on both CPPS and HNR (p {$<$} .001), whereas SS and vowel context significantly affected CPPS only (p {$<$} .05). Higher SPL, F0, and lower DUR were related to higher CPPS and HNR. SVs moderately-to-highly correlated with EVs for CPPS, whereas HNR had few and moderate correlations. In addition, CPPS and HNR highly correlated in SVs and seven EVs (p {$<$} .05). Conclusion  Speaking prosodic variations of F0, SPL, and DUR influenced both CPPS and HNR measures and led to acoustic differences between sustained and excised vowels, especially in CPPS. Vowel context, prosodic factors, and token type should be controlled for in clinical acoustic voice assessment.},

Here, we explore the critical role of such host interactions on the semimetallic state in CaIrO3 epitaxial thin film using steady-state and time-resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopies, and dc magneto transport measurements. We observe a THz optical gap of {$\sim$}1.6 meV in the Dirac bands along with a theoretically predicted topological semimetallic phase. The ultrafast dynamics of this gapped semimetallic phase, as studied by an optical-pump THz-probe tool, reveal a gigantic change in transmission that is unusual for a metal but typical of an insulating phase. As observed, this photoinduced change in THz transmission in the semimetallic phase of CaIrO3 (bandgap of a few meV) is of the same order as in the insulating phase of other correlated perovskites having a bandgap of a few eV. An extremely slow recovery time compared to that of metals and other Dirac semimetallic compounds is another anomalous feature. These observations along with anisotropy in THz optical conductivity and dc magnetoconductance along the in-plane [100] and [010] crystal axes, place CaIrO3 in a new category. This unprecedented combination of ultrafast THz dynamical properties provides valuable insights into the unified control of electron correlations and strong spin-orbit coupling in CaIrO3, along with new room-temperature ultrafast THz modulation functionalities.},

To accomplish this, SrRuO3/SrCuO2 bilayer thin films are epitaxially grown on SrTiO3 (001) substrates, and the topmost SrRuO3 layer is chemically exfoliated by etching the SrCuO2 template layer. The as-exfoliated SrRuO3 membranes are mechanically transferred to various nonoxide substrates for the subsequent BaTiO3 film growth. Finally, freestanding heteroepitaxial junctions of ferroelectric BaTiO3 and metallic SrRuO3 are realized, exhibiting robust ferroelectricity. Intriguingly, the enhancement of piezoelectric responses is identified in freestanding BaTiO3/SrRuO3 heterojunctions with mixed ferroelectric domain states. Our approaches will offer more opportunities to develop heteroepitaxial freestanding oxide membranes with high crystallinity and enhanced functionality.},

Many electrocatalysts such as metal alloy, metal oxide, and metal nitride nanoparticles undergo surface transformations and generate a different phase on the surface, forming a core-shell structure [3--5] altering the expected surface chemistry [6]. Measuring the structure, coverage and continuity of the shell, and how it coupled to the core requires a method that can provide atomic-resolution information with a depth-sensitivity beyond that of conventional imaging modes, and at a lower dose than tilt-series tomography. Multi-slice electron ptychography can in principle meet this challenge by providing a dose-efficient, high-spatial-resolution reconstruction of the scattering potential with depth information [7].},

In particular, we are able to prove, using an approximate low-energy particle-hole symmetry, that the gapped set of bands that exist around all magic angles have a nontrivial topology stabilized by a magnetic symmetry, provided band gaps appear at fillings of {\textpm}4 electrons per moir{\'e} unit cell. The topological index is given as the winding number (a Z number) of the Wilson loop in the moir{\'e} Brillouin zone. Furthermore, we also claim that, when the gapped bands are allowed to couple with higher-energy bands, the Z index collapses to a stable Z2 index. The approximate, emergent particle-hole symmetry is essential to the topology of graphene: When strongly broken, nontopological phases can appear. Our Letter underpins topology as the crucial ingredient to the description of low-energy graphene. We provide a four-band short-range tight-binding model whose two lower bands have the same topology, symmetry, and flatness as those of the twisted bilayer graphene and which can be used as an effective low-energy model. We then perform large-scale (11000 atoms per unit cell, 40 days per k-point computing time) ab initio calculations of a series of small angles, from 3{$^\circ$} to 1{$^\circ$}, which show a more complex and somewhat different evolution of the symmetry of the low-energy bands than that of the theoretical moir{\'e} model but which confirm the topological nature of the system.},

Recent examples include, for instance, the use of Josephson junctions for the detection of Majorana fermions and for superconducting qubits. All this is of great relevance and impact, especially when combined with the didactic approach of the book. The reader will benefit from a general and modern view of coherent phenomena in weakly-coupled superconductors on a macroscopic scale. Topics that have been only recently discussed in specialized papers and in short reviews are described here for the first time and organized in a general framework. An important section of the book is also devoted to applications, with focus on long-term, future applications. In addition to a significant number of illustrations, the book includes numerous tables for comparative studies on technical aspects.},

  abstract = {We describe a hybrid pixel array detector (electron microscope pixel array detector, or EMPAD) adapted for use in electron microscope applications, especially as a universal detector for scanning transmission electron microscopy. The 128{\texttimes}128 pixel detector consists of a 500 {\textmu}m thick silicon diode array bump-bonded pixel-by-pixel to an application-specific integrated circuit. The in-pixel circuitry provides a 1,000,000:1 dynamic range within a single frame, allowing the direct electron beam to be imaged while still maintaining single electron sensitivity. A 1.1 kHz framing rate enables rapid data collection and minimizes sample drift distortions while scanning. By capturing the entire unsaturated diffraction pattern in scanning mode, one can simultaneously capture bright field, dark field, and phase contrast information, as well as being able to analyze the full scattering distribution, allowing true center of mass imaging. The scattering is recorded on an absolute scale, so that information such as local sample thickness can be directly determined. This paper describes the detector architecture, data acquisition system, and preliminary results from experiments with 80--200 keV electron beams.},

CDI promises to reach resolutions below 10 nanometers, but the reconstruction procedures put stringent requirements on data quality and sample preparation. In contrast, STXM features straightforward data analysis, but its resolution is limited by the spot size on the specimen. We demonstrate a ptychographic imaging method that bridges the gap between CDI and STXM by measuring complete diffraction patterns at each point of a STXM scan. The high penetration power of x-rays in combination with the high spatial resolution will allow investigation of a wide range of complex mesoscopic life and material science specimens, such as embedded semiconductor devices or cellular networks.},

Although, for maximal utilization of this material, high-quality graphene is required at both the growth process and after transfer of the graphene film to the application-compatible substrate. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is an important method for growing high-quality graphene on non-technological substrates (as, metal substrates, e.g., copper foil). Thus, there are also considerable efforts toward the efficient and non-damaging transfer of quality of graphene on to technologically relevant materials and systems. In this review article, a range of graphene current transfer techniques are reviewed from the standpoint of their impact on contamination control and structural integrity preservation of the as-produced graphene. In addition, their scalability, cost- and time-effectiveness are discussed. We summarize with a perspective on the transfer challenges, alternative options and future developments toward graphene technology.},

Recently, a breakthrough has been achieved with the fabrication of freestanding SrTiO\$\_3\$ ultrathin films down to the monolayer limit. However, the many-body effects on the quasiparticle and optical properties of monolayer SrTiO\$\_3\$ remain unexplored. Using state-of-the-art many-body perturbation theory in the GW approximation combined with the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we study the quasiparticle band structure, optical and excitonic properties of monolayer SrTiO\$\_3\$. We show that quasiparticle corrections significantly alter the band structure topology; however, the widely used diagonal \$G\_0W\_0\$ approach yields unphysical band dispersions. The correct band dispersions are restored only by taking into account the off-diagonal elements of the self-energy. The optical properties are studied both in the optical limit and for finite momenta by computing the electron energy loss spectra. We find that the imaginary part of dielectric function at the long wavelength limit is dominated by three strongly bound excitonic peaks and the direct optical gap is associated to a bright exciton state with a large binding energy of 0.93 eV. We discuss the character of the excitonic peaks via the contributing interband transitions, and reveal that the lowest bound excitonic state becomes optical inactive for finite momenta along \${\textbackslash}Gamma\$-M, while the other two excitonic peaks disperse to higher energies and eventually merge for momenta close to M.},

Herein we report a high-mobility electron gas state with unusual symmetry at the interface of the Sr2CrMoO6/SrTiO3 (110) heterostructures, the fermiology of which follows the cubic crystallographic symmetry rather than the two-dimensional interface itself, resulting in the identical Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations with applied magnetic field along all the twelve equivalent [110] crystallographic directions of SrTiO3, distinctly different from the 2D nature of the electron gas reported previously. Neutron diffraction verifies the predicted ferrimagnetic ordering between Cr and Mo moments. This, together with the magnetic hysteresis loops and negative magnetoresistance in low-field region, suggests possible spin polarization of itinerant electrons. Therefore, a quasi-3D profile, high mobility (up to 104 cm2 V-1 s-1) and possibly spin polarized electronic state is observed in the double-perovskite-based oxide heterostructures. This finding of the electronic properties in Sr2CrMoO6/SrTiO3 (110) heterostructure expands the knowledge of interfacial physics, as well as shines light on oxide-based electronics and spintronics research.},

Phase-field simulations are performed to study the magnetic domain configurations and switching in CFO bilayers under piezostrains. An emerging interlayer parallel-to-antiparallel magnetic transition of the twisted CFO bilayer induced by appropriate piezostrain pulses generated from the PMN-PT membrane is discovered. Such a strain-induced parallel-to-antiparallel magnetic transition is non-volatile and reversible, arising from the synergistic interaction among spin, strain, and twisting order parameters.

  abstract = {Introduction Modern scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) all utilize digital scan controls, digital signal acquisition and processing of grayscale digital images. In a working digital SEM, high energy electrons are focused into a fi ne beam which rasters across the surface of a specimen pixel by pixel in incremental steps. A complex beam/specimen interaction at each pixel generates a variety of signals which are detected and exhibited on a display unit scanning in synchronism with the beam scan on the specimen. When the focused beam is addressed to a certain point on the specimen, the signal intensity is measured by a detector integrating for the dwelling time, and represented as the brightness of the pixel in a digital image. The intensity is typically digitized into a range of 8 bits which gives 256 discrete gray levels. Apparently, such gray-level images can be interpreted to reveal some characteristics of the specimen. Since image contrast is always related to some properties of the specimen, understanding the concept of contrast and its numerical meaning is of great importance in scanning electron microscopy. Various contrast mechanisms have been developed throughout the history of SEM. Common types include topographic contrast and compositional/elemental contrast which apply for virtually all specimens and provide the foundation of SEM image formation. Additionally, some special contrast mechanisms, such as electric fi eld contrast, magnetic contrast, and crystallographic contrast, exist for certain types of materials and are related closely to their special properties.}

We observe a symmetric-antisymmetric mode splitting giving rise to epsilon-near-zero and Berreman modes as well as highly confined (by a factor of 10) propagating phonon polaritons, both of which result from the deep-subwavelength thickness of the membranes.

  abstract = {Correlated oxides and related heterostructures are intriguing for developing future multifunctional devices by exploiting their exotic properties, but their integration with other materials, especially on Si-based platforms, is challenging. Here, van der Waals heterostructures of La\$\_\{0.7\}\$Sr\$\_\{0.3\}\$MnO\$\_3\$ (LSMO), a correlated manganite perovskite, and MoS\$\_2\$ are demonstrated on Si substrates with multiple functions. To overcome the problems due to the incompatible growth process, technologies involving freestanding LSMO membranes and van der Waals force-mediated transfer are used to fabricate the LSMO-MoS\$\_2\$ heterostructures. The LSMO-MoS\$\_2\$ heterostructures exhibit a gate-tunable rectifying behavior, based on which metal-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFETs) with on-off ratios of over 104 can be achieved. The LSMO-MoS\$\_2\$ heterostructures can function as photodiodes displaying considerable open-circuit voltages and photocurrents. In addition, the colossal magnetoresistance of LSMO endows the LSMO-MoS\$\_2\$ heterostructures with an electrically tunable magnetoresponse at room temperature. This work not only proves the applicability of the LSMO-MoS\$\_2\$ heterostructure devices on Si-based platform but also demonstrates a paradigm to create multifunctional heterostructures from materials with disparate properties.},

  abstract = {The control of oxygen vacancy channels (OVCs) in brownmillerite (BM) oxides has a substantial impact on tuning their physical and chemical properties. Here, we demonstrated a strain mechanism for directing the OVCs in BM-SrFeO2.5 (SFO) synthesized via a two-step process in which perovskite (P)-structured SrFeO3-{$\delta$} (P-SFO3-{$\delta$}) thin film is first prepared and then converted to the BM phase through the post-vacuum-annealing (PVA) treatment. The initial strain state for the first-step-prepared P-SFO3-{$\delta$} thin films plays a determining role in the orientation of the OVCs of the final BM phase with the systematic manipulation of both chemical strain (lattice expansion) and epitaxial strain by tuning the oxygen deficiency and using different substrates, respectively. Larger tensile strains in the initial P-SFO3-{$\delta$} thin films are inclined to facilitate the formation of BM with horizontal OVCs after PVA, while small tensile or compressive strains favor the vertical OVCs. Our results offer insights into the selective control of the orientation of the OVCs of BM-SrFeO2.5 thin films, which are of benefit to the design for functionalities related to the ion transport and migration.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the acoustic characteristics of sustained vowel /a/ and sentence utterance produced by patients with muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) using cepstrum-based acoustic variables. 36 women diagnosed with MTD and the same number of women with normal voice participated in the study and the data were recorded and measured by ADSV‚Ñ¢. The results demonstrated that cepstral peak prominence (CPP) and CPP\_F0 among all of the variables were statistically significantly lower than those of control group. When it comes to the GRBAS scale, overall severity (G) was most prominent, and roughness (R), breathiness (B), and strain (S) indices followed in order in the voice quality of MTD patients. As these characteristics increased, a statistically significant negative correlation was observed in CPP. We tried to classify MTD and control group using CPP and CPP\_F0 variables. As a result of statistic modeling with a Random Forest machine learning algorithm, much higher classification accuracy (100\% in training data and 83.3\% in test data) was found in the sentence reading task, with CPP being proved to be playing a more crucial role in both vowel and sentence reading tasks.},

  abstract = {Korean stops are currently undergoing a tonogenetic sound change, as found in the Seoul dialect in which a merged VOT of aspirated and lax stops induces F0 to be the primary cue for distinguishing the two stops and the lax stops have lower F0 than the aspirated stops. In tonal languages, low tone is produced with a breathy voice. This study investigated whether there are changes in voice quality with respect to the tonogenetic sound change of Korean stops. Two age groups speaking the Seoul dialect participated in this study: five females and six males born in the 1940s and 1950s and nine females and eight males born in the 1980s and 1990s. This study replicated previous findings of VOT and F0 and further examined H1-H2, H1-A1, and H1-A2 to see how they correlate with the sound change. In the older and younger generations, H1-H2, H1-A1, and H1-A2 were significantly lower after the tense stops than after the aspirated and lax stops, but they were not significantly different after the aspirated and lax stops. However, the younger females exhibited some different results for H1-H2 and H1-A2 than the older generation. In the younger females, the H1-H2 mean was higher after the aspirated stops than it was after the lax stops at the vowel onset, and the H1-H2 difference increased at the vowel midpoint. Although there was an inter-speaker variation in the results of H1-H2 and H1-A1, analyses of individual speakers showed that the H1-H2 and H1-A1 were higher after the lax stops than after the aspirated stops in the younger female speakers. These results indicate that lax stops tend to be breathier than aspirated stops in the younger female speakers. They also indicate that changes in voice quality are on Korean stops with tonal sound change, but are still developing.},

The localized excitons are accompanied by enhanced exciton emission, attributed to an increased oscillator strength by a theoretically forecasted flat band. This work illustrates the potential of extended ionic interaction in realizing moir{\textbackslash}'e physics at room temperature, broadening the horizon for future investigations.},

  abstract = {Releasing the epitaxial oxide heterostructures from substrate constraints leads to the emergence of various correlated electronic phases and paves the way for integrations with advanced semiconductor technologies. Identifying a suitable water-soluble sacrificial layer, compatible with the high-quality epitaxial growth of oxide heterostructures, is currently the key to the development of large-scale freestanding oxide membranes. In this study, we unveil the super-tetragonal Sr4Al2O7 (SAOT) as a promising water-soluble sacrificial layer. The distinct low-symmetric crystal structure of SAOT enables a superior capability to sustain epitaxial strain, thus allowing for broad tunability in lattice constants. The resultant structural coherency and defect-free interface in perovskite ABO3/SAOT heterostructures effectively restrain crack formations during the water-assisted release of freestanding oxide membranes. For a variety of non-ferroelectric oxide membranes, the crack-free areas can span up to a few millimeters in length scale. These compelling features, combined with the inherent high-water solubility, make SAOT a versatile and feasible sacrificial layer for producing high-quality freestanding oxide membranes, thereby boosting their potential for innovative oxide electronics and flexible device designs.},
